Index and exploration of Frederick Joseph Perazzo, Architect, AIA, work and projects

As the City of Las Vegas is moving forward on their Historic Westside Legacy Project, this writer feels that the contributions of Architect Frederick Joseph Perazzo are of value. Of particular recent revelation is the new residence for a Mrs. Lucille Hughes as reinforced by the Guide to the Elmo C. Bruner Architectural and
Real Estate Appraisal Records (https://www.library.unlv.edu/speccol/finding-aids/MS-00177.pdf, http://n2t.net/ark:/62930/f1g073). As mentioned in the Guide, Hughes, Lucille, 509 Jackson St., 1946, 1969 box 15, page 51, was one of Mr. Bruner's early appraisals. This property is now the site of Victory Missionary Baptist Church.

"Lucille Hughes, 100, of Las Vegas, died May 4, 2006. She was a retired commercial business owner/operator. She is survived by her son, Johnny of Las Vegas. Visitation will be from 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Wednesday, May 10. Service will be at 1 p.m. Thursday, May 11, at Palm Mortuary, 1325 N. Main St. Burial to follow at Palm Memorial Park-Las Vegas" ( https://obits.reviewjournal.com/us/obituaries/lvrj/name/lucille-hughes-obituary?n=lucille-hughes&pid=142036819 Published by Las Vegas Review-Journal on May 10, 2006).

I think there is more to this story than this park or plan can tell.
